        <section>Dear Students,</section><br>

        <section>Laxman Devram Sonawane College was established in the year 2002 with the aim to impart quality and
            value based education to the young minds. Our objective is not only to nurture intellectual power but also
            to develop confidence which would lead to holistic personality development of the students. More than 5500
            students get admission every year, ranging from Jr. College to P. G. Programmes, in diverse streams of
            excellence.</section><br>

        <section>Our college is situated in the prime location of Kalyan and is well equipped with modern amenities such
            as spacious classrooms, state of the art Science & Computer laboratories, and a rich library with separate
            reading rooms for boys & girls. The college also prides itself with a playground that facilitates outdoor
            sports. Students are also encouraged to participate in sports and other extra-curricular activities. The
            canteen facility provides much needed refreshments to one and all. We empower our students with additional
            skills and prepare them to face the challenges in the world outside with courage and conviction. It gives me
            immense pride to share that our college has recently been accredited by National Accreditation & Assessment
            Council (NAAC) with “B” Grade. Furthermore receiving permanent affiliation from the University at Mumbai has
            been a great achievement for our college. The ISO Certification has been is yet another feather in the cap
            for the college.</section><br>

        <section>Our college has been instrumental in shaping lives and mentoring minds year after year. It fills me
            with immense joy and pride to see thousands of students pursuing education at our college every year, who
            later progress towards becoming successful citizens and true ambassadors of the nation.</section>
