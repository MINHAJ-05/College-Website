            About L.D. Sonawane College
            Kalyan Wholesale Merchants’ Association is playing a very significant role in the social, cultural and
            educational life of Kalyan city. The Association has created a sound goodwill in the vicinity of the Kalyan

        <section>
            The Kalyan city has changed quite a lot in the last decade and observing progress in different fields. The
            ever increase in student population and insufficient centers for Higher Education are the main causes of
            motivating our Kalyan Wholesale Merchants’ Education Society to start the new Degree College in this area.
            The Society made efforts to start Arts and Commerce Degree College in the academic year 2002-2003. The
            Government of Maharashtra granted the permission to the Society to start Laxman Devram Sonawane Degree
            College of Arts and Commerce on “Permanently Non-Grant Basis” vide letter no. NCG 2002 NMV 01,2002 from the
            Higher and Technical Education Division, Mantralaya, Mumbai-400032 dated 15th July 2003. The University of
            Mumbai issued a formal permission letter to enroll the students on 22nd August, 2002, vide letter no.
            Aff/Recog/4031 dated 22/8/2002.</section>
        <section>
            In the subsequent year, we started the Junior College of Arts, Commerce and Science. In the same year the
            Society was given permission to introduce three years Degree Course of Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS).
            During the academic year 2008-2009, we started B. Sc. in Computer Science and Information Technology. In the
            academic year 2011-2012, we have introduced Post –Graduate Courses; M. Com in Advanced Accountancy and M.
            Sc. in Information Technology. We also offer plain science subjects as Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics,
            Botany, Zoology and Microbiology in our degree college. We started MA in Economics & History in 2013 -14. In
            2019-20 we started BAF and BBI considering the increasing demand for such courses.</section>
