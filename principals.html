<section>From the Principal’s Desk…</section><br>

<section>It gives me great pleasure and joy to communicate to our youngsters and readers through this medium. The Laxman Devram Sonawane Degree College, Kalyan, conducted by the Kalyan Wholesale Merchant’s Education Society was established in the academic year 2002-2003. It is an affiliate of University of Mumbai with more than 5500 students on its roll. We believe in multi-disciplinary approach and provide the best educational facilities to our students. We offer Bachelor’s degree in History, Economics and Commerce. The new need-based and self- financing courses provided at Degree College include BMS course, B.Sc. in Information Technology and Computer Science. At +2 level, we have Arts, Science and Commerce alongwith subjects like Computer Science, Information Technology and Electronics.</section><br>

<section>The 21 st  century is an era of modernization, industrialization and globalization and is therefore filled with competition across all fields or knowledge. To accept and face these challenges confidently, knowledge is going to prove as a decisive factor as well as a game changing ingredient.</section><br>

<section>The Indian youth today have a plethora of global opportunities available to them, provided they demonstrate the right skills and exhibit the right attitude. In order to meet the demands of these dynamic times, our college has introduced robust courses such as M.Com in Advanced Accountancy, M. Sc. in Information Technology and M. A. in History & Economics.</section><br>

<section>Education is meant not only to impart formal education but also to disseminate practical knowledge thus enabling overall personality of the students. Keeping this objective in mind, the college has been organizing various extra-curricular and co-curricular activities at regular intervals of time. Initiatives such as the National Service Scheme (NSS) we aim to build social
awareness and character of the students. Through different bodies like Marathi Vangmaya Mandal, Hindi Vangmaya Mandal, English Literacy Association, History Association, Economics Association, Science Association, WDC, DLLE etc. play a pivotal role in boosting students’ confidence and enhancing their personality.</section><br>

<section>Our faculty members continually strive to keep themselves updated with the latest developments in their areas of expertise. This year has also witnessed some faculty members initiating their journey towards academic excellence through research. Most of them have attended and actively participated in Seminars, Conferences and Workshops, Syllabi discussion meetings organized by other Colleges or University of Mumbai. We also organize international conferences, workshops, intercollegiate events at consistent intervals to facilitate knowledge exchange and to imbibe best practices in the education sector.</section><br>

<section>The academic performance of the students has been very promising. The college results at H.S.C. Board examination and University examination have been encouraging. The credit for these stupendous results goes to our experienced, qualified and efficient teaching faculty who work relentlessly towards enhancing student performance.</section><br>

<section>Our college office and library are modernized and computerized. We have also introduced “One Window Scheme” for the benefit of students.</section><br>

<section>Finally, we assure you that at this college you will find holistic, vibrant and ntellectual work culture.</section>
