            Higher Education does not mean only the teaching-learning and evaluation process but it also helps in
            personality development of students. We know that the social transformation is possible through the dynamic
            education, hence we believe in importance of value based learning, which is of great relevance in a dynamic
            and ever changing competitive work environment. We provide easy access to faculty guidance, full staff
            support and caring and nurturing environment to our students. The students are motivated and encouraged to
            participate in various extra-curricular activities leading to their overall personality development
